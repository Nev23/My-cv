      Now, this is a story all about how
      My life got flipped-turned upside down
      And I'd like to take a minute
      Just sit right there
      I'll tell you how I became the king of a town called Blackburn
      In North West Lancashire born and raised
      On the playground was where I spent most of my days
      Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool
      And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
      When a couple of guys who were up to no good
      Started making trouble in my neighborhood
      I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
      She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Blackburn"
      I begged and pleaded with her day after day
      But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
      She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
      I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it"
      First class, yo this is bad
      Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
      Is this what the people of Blackburn living like?
      Hmm, this might be alright
      But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
      Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
      I don't think so
      I'll see when I get there
      I hope they're prepared for the king of Blackburn
      Well, the day landed and when I came out
      There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
      I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here
      I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
      I whistled for a cab and when it came near
      The license plate said, "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror
      If anything I could say that this cab was rare
      But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Blackburn"
      I pulled up to the house about seven or eight
      And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo holmes, smell ya later"
      I looked at my kingdom
      I was finally there
      To sit on my throne as the king of Blackburn.</p>
